# Changelog

User-facing release notes. The release script (`scripts/publish-release.sh`)
reads the section matching the version being shipped and embeds it in the GitHub
release and the Sparkle appcast, so this file is the single source of truth for
"what's new" — keep each version's prose written for users, not commit-speak.

## 0.3.65

**One word now for reopening an app to finish its update.** An app whose own updater had already put the new version in place asked you to "Restart" it; one that keeps the new version aside until you quit asked you to "Relaunch" it. That difference was real behind the scenes and made none to you: the same click either way, and the same outcome if you never click, since the update lands the next time you quit the app regardless. It reads Relaunch throughout now — including the notifications, the tooltips and the setting that does it for you — which is also the word Chrome, Claude and most apps that update themselves put in front of you. Only English ever had two words for this; German, Japanese, Russian and Chinese have always used one, and Spanish and French move onto the wording they were already using elsewhere.

## 0.3.64

**An update that needs an administrator now asks for one, instead of failing and blaming a permission.** Whether a swap needed a password was decided by looking at the folder an app sits in rather than at the app itself. Anything macOS installed as root — every App Store app, and any app an installer package laid down — passed that test, took the route that needs no password, and could not possibly finish: removing the old version requires write access to the directories inside it. macOS reports that refusal with the same code it uses for a denied App Management permission, so the failure arrived as a request to grant App Management, which could never help, because the obstacle was file ownership. On an ordinary Mac that was every App Store app and a handful of others besides, and it was administrator accounts it hit — standard accounts were already being routed correctly. Those updates now take the route that works, and the app keeps the owner it had rather than quietly becoming yours.

**App Store apps now get a rollback point like everything else.** Backups skipped them, on the reasoning that the store can always fetch a previous build back. It cannot — the App Store offers only an app's current version — which left the store as the one route that applied an update with no way to undo it. Those apps are now backed up before an update like any other, and because the copy is made by cloning it costs almost no disk space until the update actually replaces the original. Restoring one says the thing that is specific to the store: the update reappears in the Updates list straight away, and is re-applied on its own if automatic app updates are switched on. And when a store update was never going to be applied — an iPhone app running on a Mac, a title not sold in your region — no rollback point is taken any more, so a row can no longer offer to roll back to the version it is already running.

**Longbridge Desktop is now tracked, on both of its release trains.** Stable and Preview each get version detection, one-click installation of the official Apple silicon build, and release notes rendered in Duo Updater's own window, illustrations included.

**WhatsApp's release notes now appear while its App Store check is still running.** The App Store page shown in that window had been filed under a name the lookup could never match, so the notes pane sat empty instead of showing it.

**The menu header carries more in less room.** Duo Updater's own version now sits beside its name, and clicking it opens its release notes. "Update All" has moved onto its own line, where a translated label has room to be read in full, and the actions along the bottom are icons. The banner that used to announce Duo Updater updating itself is gone — the sparkle beside the version lights up instead, and stays lit until you have read what changed. A status line too long for the menu now ends in an ellipsis rather than stretching it.

**Settings no longer cuts short the update choices it is offering.** The two menus that decide how an update is applied were clipping their own labels in several languages. The wording is shorter now, and they move onto a second line where the words still need it.

**What's New says when each version shipped.** Every version in the rail now carries its publication date.

## 0.3.63

**Architecture-specific updates now choose the build this Mac can actually run.** A few apps publish the same version twice in one Sparkle feed — once for Apple silicon and once for Intel — and Duo Updater used to break that tie by whichever download address happened to sort first. It now reads the feed's hardware requirement and, where a vendor leaves that blank, the architecture in the filename. The native build wins consistently, and a build this Mac cannot launch is not offered. GitHub releases get the same treatment, without calling a perfectly healthy recipe broken just because its newest artifact targets another architecture.

**ChatGPT update checks now follow the rollout track attached to the account.** OpenAI sometimes holds business and enterprise accounts on an earlier desktop build while a new one reaches consumer accounts first. Duo Updater used to omit the account's plan from that check, which silently selected the cautious track for everyone: it could say the installed copy was somehow ahead while ChatGPT itself was already downloading a newer build, or offer a build the app's own updater would replace again. It now sends the plan label from the ChatGPT/Codex sign-in state with the same update request the app makes. If that label is unavailable it keeps the cautious behavior; credentials themselves are never put into the request or diagnostics.

**A relaunch that macOS never answers can no longer wedge every later update.** Launch Services occasionally accepts a request to reopen an updated app and then never calls back. The row stayed on “Relaunching…” forever, its Restart button remained disabled, and Duo Updater's own update waited behind it. A launch that has not answered after a minute is now released as failed, so the row recovers and the rest of the updater keeps working.

**Release Log stays populated when its scrollbar is dragged quickly.** The old lazy stack could be outrun by a long jump, briefly leaving a blank window while rows were created around the new position. The log now uses a recycling list that can jump directly to the destination. The refresh control also keeps the same footprint while changing between its arrow and spinner, so the bottom row no longer twitches when a check starts.

**Download Traffic now marks updates that used a binary patch.** New downloads record the route that actually completed — not merely whether a patch was offered — and carry a Delta badge in their history. The unmistakably smaller patch downloads from 0.3.62 are recognised too, even though they were recorded before the traffic ledger had a route field.

## 0.3.62

**Updates now download only what changed, when the developer publishes it that way.** Some apps ship a small patch alongside each release — enough to turn the version you have into the new one, without fetching the whole thing again. Duo Updater used to ignore those and download the full package every time. It now takes the patch when one matches the exact build you're on. ChatGPT's last update came to 1.9 MB instead of 605 MB; Docker's to 87 MB instead of 582 MB. The result is the identical application either way — same signature, same bytes, verified against the full download before this shipped. When no patch fits what you have, or one fails to apply, the full download happens as before, so nothing can fail to install because of this.

**Duo Updater no longer downloads an update an app is already downloading itself.** Many apps update themselves as well, and both of us reaching for the same 600 MB file at the same time cost you that file twice. Duo Updater now notices a download in progress and leaves it alone, saying so on the row rather than doing nothing silently. If that download turns out to be abandoned, it stops counting after ten minutes so nothing stays blocked.

**An update an app has already prepared is no longer overwritten.** Apps that update themselves often download in the background and then wait for you to quit them before swapping the new version in. Installing over one of those looked like it worked and then came undone the moment you quit the app — and where the app's own pending version was older than what Duo Updater had just installed, you ended up further behind than when you started. Those updates are now left to finish, whichever version they carry.

**Duo Updater's own updates got smaller too.** Its releases now ship the same kind of patch, so updating from a recent version fetches a few hundred kilobytes instead of eleven megabytes.

## 0.3.61

**Explanations left behind by an update now clear themselves.** When Duo Updater hands an app over to its own updater, the row says so — "brought it to the front so its own updater applies the update". That sentence used to stay there for good: the only thing that ever removed it was starting another update on the same app, so it was still sitting under the row long after the update had landed, describing something that finished hours ago. It now goes as soon as the app is up to date. A warning that an update was applied without a rollback point is deliberately left alone, because that one describes the update that already happened and only starts to matter once it is over.

**An update that was refused now explains itself in your language.** When something else is already installing — Duo Updater working through a batch, or `duo` in a terminal — the row tells you so. That message was English only, in an otherwise translated window, and it ended with a process number: useful in a terminal, and nothing you can act on in a menu. It is now translated, and says what to do rather than who has the lock. The command-line tool still prints the process number, where you can do something with it.

**The release-pattern line, and its clock, now follow your locale.** Release Log → Patterns summed everything up as "Most often ships Friday, around 6 PM". Languages that inflect the names of days cannot say that with the day dropped into the middle of the sentence, and got the wrong form of the word — Russian read "Чаще всего выходит пятница" where it needs "по пятницам". It is now a label: "Peak: Friday, around 6 PM", which is correct everywhere. The time goes with it — if your Mac writes clock times on a 24-hour dial, so does this, on the chart's axis too.

**Settings search now understands the words on your screen.** The search field above the settings sidebar matched a list of extra terms that was written in English and never translated, so "rollback" reached General while "Zurücksetzen" and "回滚" reached nothing. Those terms now exist in every language Duo Updater speaks. The English ones still work in every language too, since the documentation they come from is in English.

## 0.3.60

**Turning on "Show all" no longer makes the menu hesitate.** The full list of every app you have was measured in its entirety each time it appeared — on a Mac with 127 apps that came to roughly a second of work, nearly all of it spent laying out rows far below the ones you can see. It was paid on every toggle, not just the first. Only the rows actually on screen are built now.

**An explanation left over from a failed update no longer outlives the failure.** When an update couldn't be applied — because something else was already installing, say — the row said why, in red. Nothing ever took that line away: once the update did land and the row went back to a tick, the old explanation was still sitting underneath it, and it stayed there through every re-check until Duo Updater was restarted. It now goes as soon as the app is up to date. Reasons belonging to updates that are still waiting are left alone, so one you haven't read yet can't be wiped by a check running in the background.

**The "Update All" button no longer changes size with the length of the list.** With only a few updates pending it was drawn a size smaller than it should have been, with eighty points of empty space beside it, and jumped back to its proper size whenever the list grew. It now stays the size it is meant to be.

## 0.3.59

**Download Traffic now says which build an update moved to, not just which version.** Plenty of apps ship several builds under one version name — Surge put four separate releases out as "6.9.0" — so those rows read "6.9.0 → 6.9.0" and told you nothing. They now read "6.9.0 (12028) → 6.9.0 (12030)", and only when the version name alone isn't enough; where the version already changed, the build number would just be noise and is left out.

**The build recorded is the one that actually landed, read off the app itself once the update is in place.** Not the number the developer's update feed advertised — feeds do misreport, and this way it also works for the places that publish no build number at all: GitHub, Homebrew and the App Store. An update still waiting on macOS's installer window is never guessed at; nothing is recorded for it until it's real.

**A download that changed nothing is now marked as such.** Occasionally an update fetches and installs the build that was already on your Mac — a version-number mismatch on the developer's side, a mirror serving what you already have. That is real bandwidth spent for no result, and the traffic window is where you would want to see it. Those rows now carry a "no change" tag. Downloads recorded before this release don't have build numbers to compare, so they are left alone rather than guessed at: unknown is not the same as unchanged.

## 0.3.58

**Duo Updater now shows you what keeping your apps up to date has actually cost in downloads.** It has been counting, to the byte, every update it fetched for you — but the count had nowhere to appear, so the number sat in a file nobody could read. There is now a Download Traffic window, opened from the chart button at the bottom of the menu, with this month's figure printed next to that button so the most common question is answered without opening anything. Inside: the total, the last three months side by side with the change between them, a breakdown of where the bytes came from, and every app ranked by how much it has cost — click one to see each update it took, which version it went from and to, and how big that download was.

**The total is honest about what it cannot see.** Homebrew, the App Store, and apps that update through their own built-in updater fetch their own bytes, and Duo Updater never handles them — so the figure is a floor, not a full accounting. That has always been true; what changed is that the window says so permanently, rather than only on the empty screen you see before anything has been recorded.

**Apps you have since renamed or deleted keep their history.** Traffic is recorded against where an app lives on disk, which is what lets two channels of the same app — Android Studio Canary and Beta, say — stay apart instead of being added together. The cost is that renaming an app leaves its past under a name that no longer exists. When OpenAI renamed Codex to ChatGPT, that split 30 GB of downloads across two entries that looked like duplicates. Those entries are now grouped and dimmed at the bottom of the list, under a heading that says what they are. Nothing is thrown away, and the total still includes them.

## 0.3.57

**An app you installed from the App Store is no longer offered the developer's own download.** Plenty of apps are published in two places at once — in the store, and as a direct download from the developer's own site — under the same identity but as genuinely different builds. The direct download usually runs ahead, because it doesn't wait for store review. Duo Updater checks the store first for a store-installed app, but when that check failed for any reason — a dropped connection, a storefront that didn't answer — it quietly moved on to the developer's site and offered you whatever was there. WhatsApp showed this as "26.32.75 → 26.33.19": a real version, from the wrong place. Taking it would have replaced your store copy with one the App Store could never update again. Store-installed apps are now checked against the store and nowhere else.

**Switching an app's update channel inside that app now registers straight away.** Some apps let you choose between their normal releases and their beta ones — Surge, Tailscale, Fork, OrbStack, IINA, Alfred and others — and Duo Updater follows whichever you picked so it never offers you a build you didn't ask for. It used to notice the change only when you quit the app or opened one of Duo Updater's windows. Neither covers what people actually do: turn the setting off, leave the app running, and glance at the menu bar. Worse, apps save that setting to disk when it suits them rather than the moment you click — Surge took five minutes here — so even quitting could be read too early. Duo Updater now watches for the setting itself changing and re-checks that one app within a second or two. Switching Surge back to normal releases now clears the beta version from its row immediately, instead of leaving it there for up to an hour.

**A check that couldn't reach anything no longer looks like a clean bill of health.** When every source failed — no network, or a proxy quietly refusing connections while the Wi-Fi icon still says everything is fine — the apps that failed were hidden and the panel said "127 apps · up to date". That is the same screen you get when everything genuinely is up to date, which made a failed check indistinguishable from a successful one. The panel now says how many apps it couldn't reach, shows what went wrong, and offers to try those again — just those, leaving everything it did manage to check alone.

## 0.3.56

**A helper macOS wouldn't switch on no longer sends you to reset your whole Mac.** App Store updates install through a small background item macOS asks you to approve once. When that approval was refused, Duo Updater had exactly one explanation for it: the system's record of the item is damaged, and repairing it takes a Terminal command that clears the background-item approvals of *every* app on your Mac. That is one cause among several, and macOS never says which one applies — the ordinary one is that the switch is simply off. The message now leads with that instead: turn Duo Updater on under "Allow in the Background" in Login Items & Extensions, and Duo Updater opens the pane for you. The Terminal reset is still written down, as the fallback for when Duo Updater isn't listed there or switching it on changes nothing. The message also stopped running off the edge of its card.

**Two Settings options read on one line again.** The two options under Install routing — how App Store updates install, and what happens to apps that ship their own updater — used to put their name to the left of the menu, the way options do everywhere else on macOS. Adding six languages moved both names above their menus instead, because a German or Russian option can be long enough to run off the end of the line, and the safe layout was applied to every language at once. Each row now decides for itself: the name stays beside the menu as long as the menu leaves room for it, and only moves above when the text genuinely needs the width. In English, Japanese and Chinese both rows are back on one line; in German and French they stay stacked, which is the only way they fit without being cut off.

## 0.3.55

**Duo Updater now speaks Russian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, German, French and Spanish.** It follows whatever language your Mac is set to, and switches with it — there is nothing to turn on. If you would rather read it in a language your Mac isn't set to, macOS can do that per app: System Settings ▸ General ▸ Language & Region ▸ Applications. Everything the app writes itself is translated: the menu-bar panel, every Settings page, the setup window, the notifications, the alerts, and the small print under each option. Counts are handled the way each language actually handles them rather than by bolting an "s" onto the end, which matters most in Russian, where "1 update", "2 updates" and "5 updates" take three different endings — and in Chinese and Japanese, where they take none.

**Two things stay in English on purpose.** Release notes are the vendor's own words, so they arrive in whatever language the vendor wrote them in — translating them would mean rewriting what a developer said about their own release. And the `duo` command-line tool stays English, the way command-line tools generally are.

## 0.3.54

**An App Store app that was open when you updated it comes back again.** Last release drew a line in the wrong place. It was fixing something real — an update that failed, or that you cancelled, could bring an app back to life minutes after you had closed it yourself — but it decided *whether to reopen* by asking whether someone had answered a quit prompt. Almost no App Store update shows one: the prompt only appears on a route Duo Updater stopped using a while ago. So from 0.3.53, updating an App Store app that was running closed it and left it closed, with nothing on screen to say why. The question it asks now is whether the update actually landed, which is the thing that decides whether a quit is coming at all. This is verified against a real App Store update rather than reasoned about: the store terminates your app to replace its files and never brings it back — despite its own prompt promising that it will.

**Duo Updater now tells you when App Store is waiting on you.** The store cannot replace an app while it is open, so it puts up a "cannot be open during installation" prompt and waits — with no time limit, holding the update and a download slot for as long as it takes. That prompt is a small panel inside App Store's own window, which may be sitting on some entirely unrelated page; App Store bounces its Dock icon a few times and gives up; and Duo Updater lives in the menu bar with no Dock icon to bounce. An update could sit there indefinitely with nothing anywhere telling you a click was needed — one took four and a half minutes here, ending only because someone thought to look. The row now says what is being waited for, from the moment the update starts.

**The dot that marks an app as open no longer lags behind.** macOS does not reliably announce that an app has launched — some apps never trigger it at all, while quitting is always announced. Duo Updater listened only for those announcements, so a row could insist an app was closed while its window sat in front of you, and only correct itself when some unrelated app happened to open or quit. It now re-derives which apps are running whenever it rescans, which includes the moment you open the menu.

**Two things a review caught before you did.** The warning that an update was applied without a rollback point was being erased before it could be read: restarting an app cleared the whole note, and restarting after an update is the default. It is now retracted only by whoever wrote it. And Update All could refuse to restart an app — telling you its own updater had a version staged and waiting — when nothing was staged at all: it compared what was on disk now against a build number recorded before the install, so an app whose version name had not changed looked like a conflict.

## 0.3.53

**An app that already downloaded its own update is no longer asked to download it again.** Plenty of apps fetch their next version quietly in the background and hold it until you next quit them — that's the "relaunch to update" state you see inside Claude, TablePlus and others. Duo Updater has always recognised that state in Electron apps and offered you Relaunch instead of an Update, because the bytes are already on your disk. Apps built on Sparkle, which is most of the rest, were invisible to it: TablePlus sat there with a 133 MB download and an unpacked 382 MB copy of 26.9.11 in its cache, while its row offered to fetch 26.9.11 for you all over again. Those apps are now recognised too — the row offers Relaunch, and nothing is downloaded twice.

**One thing it deliberately won't do is offer Relaunch for an older build.** An app can be holding a version *behind* the one you have, which happens when a vendor releases to some people before others and Duo Updater installed the newer one first. Relaunching there would quietly move you backwards, so the row doesn't offer it — and Duo Updater won't restart the app for you either, because that restart is the exact signal the app's own installer is waiting for.

**Three ways an update could go wrong that a review caught before you did.** An App Store update that failed, or that you cancelled, could bring the app back to life minutes later — you would quit it yourself and it would reopen, because Duo Updater had noted "this app may need reopening" before anything had actually closed it. It now only reopens an app when a quit was genuinely asked for. Separately, the check added last release to stop an app's own updater undoing ours compared only the version *name*: a vendor that ships several builds under one version number slipped straight past it, which is the same failure it was written to prevent. It now compares the build number too. And an app's own updater is no longer assumed to be waiting just because a downloaded copy is sitting in its cache — Sparkle leaves those behind for ten days after an interrupted install, which could have left a Restart button that did nothing but explain itself.

## 0.3.52

**Same changes as 0.3.51, reissued so it can actually reach you.** 0.3.51 went out carrying the same internal build number as 0.3.50. That number, not the one in the version name, is what an update check compares — so anyone already running 0.3.50 was told they were up to date and never offered it. This release carries the changes below under a build number that is properly newer. If you are reading this on 0.3.51, nothing about the app changed between the two.

## 0.3.51

**An update that kept coming back.** ChatGPT would offer a new version, install it, restart — and a minute later the same update was waiting again. The install was never the problem: the new version really did land on disk. What happened next is that ChatGPT's own updater put a different one back. There are two lists involved, and Duo Updater was reading the wrong one. The first is everything the vendor has published; the second is what the vendor is actually handing out to your Mac today, which can be an earlier build while a release is still rolling out. Duo Updater was reading the published list — the same address ChatGPT itself is configured with, which is what made it look right — and offering you a build the vendor was still holding back. ChatGPT had meanwhile downloaded the build it *was* being offered and parked it, waiting for the app to close. Restarting to apply our update is what closed it. Duo Updater now asks the same question ChatGPT's own updater asks, so the two agree on what the current version is.

**Restarting an app no longer applies somebody else's update.** That collision isn't unique to ChatGPT. A lot of apps download their next version quietly and install it the instant you quit them — the "relaunch to update" state you've seen in Claude, TablePlus and others. They'll wait hours for that quit; one was observed holding on for nearly seven. When Duo Updater restarts an app to put its own update into effect, that restart is exactly the signal they're waiting for, and theirs runs second. Before restarting, Duo Updater now checks whether anything is waiting, and what version it holds. If it's the same version — which is the common case, and harmless — nothing changes. If it's a different one, the app isn't restarted: the row says what's waiting and leaves the choice to you, rather than quietly swapping in a build you didn't pick.

**An App Store update no longer leaves your app closed.** Updating an app you have open through the App Store means closing it — the store's own installer quits it to replace the bundle, and doesn't open it again afterwards. Duo Updater knew to reopen it, but only if you'd answered its own "quit to finish updating" prompt. Answer the identical prompt in the App Store window instead, or take an update that raises no prompt at all, and nothing remembered that your app had been open. It updated correctly, said "Updated ✓", and your app was simply gone — with no restart offered, because by then there was no running app to restart. What decides now is whether the app was running when the update started, which is the thing that was actually true, rather than which window you happened to click in.

## 0.3.50

**豆包输入法 now gets checked, and shows its release notes.** It was in the list — Duo Updater looks inside `/Library/Input Methods` — but nothing anywhere knew where to ask about it, so the row sat blank forever and read like "nothing to do". It now reads the same endpoint the vendor's own download button reads, and compares the same build number the vendor versions by — so even a re-release that keeps the version name unchanged shows up, rather than passing as the version you already have. The release notes come from the feed the input method's own updater polls, laid out as a proper list rather than a link to a page that doesn't exist. As with 微信输入法, Duo Updater will tell you a new version is out but will not install it for you: an input method is registered with the system by its installer, not merely copied into place, and quietly swapping the bundle is how you lose your personal dictionary.

**Zed's release notes come back instead of an error.** Duo Updater asks GitHub about a lot of apps, and GitHub lets an unidentified caller ask only sixty questions an hour from one network — a budget every GitHub-hosted app on your machine shares. Zed's notes were the ones losing that race, and the panel showed a failure rather than the notes. Those requests now carry the GitHub token you saved in Settings ▸ GitHub, or the one the `gh` command-line tool already holds if you use it, which lifts the limit far out of the way. Without a token nothing gets worse: Zed's notes now come from a single, smaller source that covers both its channels, where before each one fetched its own web page.

**Notion's release notes are about the app you have.** They were being read from Notion's product announcements — the page that introduces features as they launch. Those posts are titled by feature, not by version, so nothing on that page ever lined up with the version number on Notion's row, and the notes for the update you were being offered were never there to find. They now come from Notion's own "What's new" page for the Mac and Windows app, where the versions are the ones you can actually compare against.

**Some release notes were quietly incomplete, and no longer are.** A release's final line could go missing from ChatWise's notes. Two of Postman's releases were cut off mid-sentence — both at the exact point where the text contained a quotation mark. Six apps' notes are now read from the same data the vendor's own site is built from, rather than picked out of the finished page, which is both sturdier and how those two ended up whole. HBuilderX is the one trade-off: its notes now come from the official release document, which covers the HBuilderX editor itself and not the bundled uni-app and uniCloud module logs, so its entries are shorter than before — the same releases, in the vendor's own words, minus the parts about other products.

**Release notes that arrive inside an app's update feed are laid out properly.** A good number of apps ship their notes as a small piece of a web page tucked inside the feed their updater reads. Duo Updater used to hand that straight to the system's HTML renderer, which produced a serif font nothing else in the app uses, bullets indented into the margin, and — the part that mattered — a long list could be cut in half, with everything after the cut silently absent. Those notes are now read into the same list layout the rest of the panel uses: right font, right indentation, and nothing dropped. Where the markup is too tangled to be sure of, Duo Updater leaves it to the old renderer rather than risk showing you part of a list as if it were all of it. TablePro benefits most — its notes had stopped being found at all.

**Four more apps show their release notes properly, instead of an embedded web page.** Alcove, Docker, Kiro and Waku each publish their notes somewhere a program can read them — Alcove and Docker on their own sites, Kiro as a feed, Waku on GitHub — but Duo Updater was showing you the web page instead, which meant the vendor's fonts, the vendor's navigation, and no way to move between versions. They now read as proper entries in the list, the same as everything else. Kiro's feed covers three separate products; only the notes for the app you have installed are shown.

**A release whose notes are written as sentences no longer vanishes.** Some releases don't have a bulleted list of changes — they have a line or two of prose, sometimes only "no public-facing changes in this release". Duo Updater understood lists and nothing else, so those releases were skipped entirely: if you happened to be running exactly that version, the panel had no entry for it at all, as though your own build had never shipped. They're kept now. Where the notes are laid out in a way that still can't be read cleanly — a table, mostly — the page is shown as before rather than half-converted into something misleading.

**Antigravity IDE gets checked.** It's a separate app from Antigravity, with its own version, and it was in your list but nothing ever checked it — the row just sat there with no version to compare against and no way to find out. It's checked now. Duo Updater won't install it for you; it will tell you when a new version is out and where to get it.

**Duo Updater tells you when it updated itself, and what changed.** It installs its own updates quietly, on purpose — it waits until you're away from the machine and swaps itself without asking, because a tool that interrupts you to talk about itself is getting in the way of the work it's supposed to protect. The cost was that you'd end up on a new version you never agreed to and never saw the notes for: every other app in your list has a "what changed" panel, and the one app that changed under you in silence was this one. Now the menu says so once, and opens its release notes. It's shown until you read it rather than for a set time — the update this is for is the one that landed while you were asleep. A fresh install doesn't get told it was updated, because it wasn't, and going back to an older build on purpose doesn't either.

**And you can read those notes any time.** The ✨ button at the bottom of the menu opens every release Duo Updater has ever shipped, with the one you're running marked in the list.

**Switching an app's update channel in that app is noticed straight away.** Some apps let you choose between their stable and pre-release builds in their own settings — Tailscale, Fork, Surge, OrbStack, TablePlus, CleanShot, IINA, Alfred, DuoPaste. That choice lives in the app's own preferences, where nothing tells Duo Updater it has changed, so switching from a beta track back to stable left the row still comparing you against the beta — and still offering it — until the next scheduled check, up to an hour later. Duo Updater now re-reads that choice when one of those apps opens or quits, and when you come back to its own window, and re-checks just the app that changed.

**Tailscale's Release Candidate track is one of the choices Duo Updater understands.** Tailscale publishes three: stable, release candidate, and unstable. Only two were known here, so a Mac opted into release candidates was quietly checked against stable instead, and reported up to date whenever a candidate build was newer than the stable one. All three are now checked against the track you actually chose.

## 0.3.49

**Confirming a quit late no longer leaves the app updated but closed.** Some apps guard their own quit with a dialog — Claude, for one, asks about an active conversation — and that dialog could land in the middle of a Relaunch. Duo Updater rightly refuses to sit there while you decide (and it still won't force the quit past your unsaved work), but once it stepped aside it also stopped listening. Answer the dialog a minute later and the quit went through, the app's own updater swapped in the new version — and then nothing happened: some updaters deliberately don't reopen the app after installing, Duo Updater was no longer watching, and you were left staring at an app that had simply closed. It now leaves a note for itself when it steps aside: if you do confirm that quit within the next few minutes, it waits for the update to finish landing and then brings the app back, in front if that's where it was. The note expires after a few minutes, so a quit hours later is just you closing the app, and stays that way.

**The same late answer now works for a plain Restart.** A save prompt could block the Restart button (and the automatic restart that follows a one-click Update) in exactly the same way, with a worse ending: the new version was already on disk, so when you finally dismissed that prompt and the app closed, Duo Updater's next look around decided there was nothing left to restart and quietly dropped the badge too — an app closed, an update half-applied, and no trace that anything had been asked for. Answering a save prompt within a few minutes now finishes the restart it belonged to, and the app comes back on the new version.

**App Store updates tell you they're waiting, and don't leave the app closed if you answer late.** When the App Store finishes downloading an update for an app you have open, it asks for that app to be closed before it can install — and Duo Updater waits, indefinitely and on purpose, for you to say when. Until now that request lived only inside the menu: if you never opened it, an update sat downloaded-but-not-installed all night, and background checks waited with it. It now also arrives as a notification with a Relaunch button, so you can answer it without hunting for the row. And if your app puts up a save prompt of its own after you tap Relaunch, answering it minutes later no longer strands the app closed — the update lands and the app is reopened, the same as if it had quit right away.

**The list holds still while you are clicking down it.** Every finished update used to re-sort the list on the spot: the app that just landed left the pending group, or picked up a Restart badge and jumped to the top, and everything below it slid up a row — under the pointer of anyone working down a list of Update buttons. Click the top one, go for the next, and the next one had moved. Now the order is held from the first click until the whole round is done: an app that finishes shows its confirmation in place, nothing else moves, and the list settles once at the end, when the finished apps drop away as they always did.

**One less version number on a row that needs a restart.** An app with an update waiting *and* an earlier update still needing a restart tried to print all three versions on one line — installed, available, and the older one still running. On four-part versions like Chrome's it did not fit, and the line was cut off exactly where the digits started to differ, so the part left visible said nothing at all. The line now sticks to the comparison that matters — what you have and what is offered — and the running version moved to the row's tooltip, where it fits.

## 0.3.48

**No more Dock icon.** Duo Updater is a menu-bar app — everything it does starts from the icon up there — but it also held a Dock slot, and the only thing that slot ever did was open the same window the menu bar opens. It now runs from the menu bar alone. If you would rather keep the Dock icon, Settings ▸ General ▸ "Hide the Dock icon" turns it back on, and with it the badge that shows the number of pending updates; hidden, that count lives on the menu-bar icon instead.

**An app you ignored is no longer checked at all.** Ignoring an app hid its row, but every check still asked its vendor after it — one network request per app per round, spent on an answer nothing would ever be said about. On an unauthenticated GitHub budget of sixty requests an hour, those were requests taken from the apps you do watch. Ignoring now means not asking, which is what "hide an app from update checks" always claimed. Naming an app on the command line still checks it, and so does asking for hidden rows, since both are you asking about that app specifically. Skipping a *version* is unchanged and still checked — whether the version on offer is still the one you skipped can only be known by asking. And un-ignoring re-checks that app on the spot, instead of leaving the row blank until the next round comes due.

**An app you ignored stops notifying you.** An app that updates itself leaves a "Relaunch to apply it" reminder in Notification Center and repeats it every few minutes until you act on it. That reminder never consulted the ignore list, so an app you had ignored went on sending it — hidden in Duo Updater's own list, still arriving every five minutes, with nothing on screen to explain where it was coming from. Ignoring an app now silences those reminders and clears any already waiting in Notification Center. Skipping a version does the same for that version.

**A download no longer squeezes the app's name or its version off the row.** While an app was downloading, the progress bar and its percentage claimed enough of the row that a long name wrapped onto a second line, a long date-style version was clipped at both ends to something unreadable, and at 100% the percentage itself broke across two lines. The row now measures what the name and the version actually need and fits the progress readout into what's left: the bar gives way to a compact ring, and the percentage stays. Nothing is given up until there is genuinely no room for it.

## 0.3.47

**An update no longer looks like it fired twice.** With one update pending, installing it briefly emptied the list: the row dropped out the moment the new version reached the disk, the "Everything is up to date" placeholder took its place and jumped the window's height, and then the row reappeared saying "Relaunching...". Nothing was actually wrong underneath — the app still had to be restarted to run the new code — but it read as though something had happened twice. The row now stays where it is from the click through to the relaunch. The step that used to announce "Done" while the app was still being restarted says "Installed" instead; "finished" is left for the confirmation at the end, where it belongs.

**The workbench sidebar follows the arrow keys again.** Holding an arrow key walked the selection off the edge of the list and left it there, moving through apps that were never drawn and not catching up when the keys stopped. The selected app stays in view.

**Moving through that sidebar is quicker.** Every keypress was re-deriving, once per app per row, a fact about the whole list that had not changed — on a machine with 124 apps that came to about fifteen thousand redundant filesystem-path lookups per keystroke. It is derived once now. Fast key repeat can still outrun the list; there is more to do here.

**An App Store update says "Update", not "Get".** When the background helper has not been approved there is no way to install an App Store update in place, so the row hands off to the App Store app instead — but the button for that read "Get", which is what the store says about an app you do not own yet. Every row that reaches it is an app you already have, with an update waiting. It says "Update" now, and when the helper is what is missing the tooltip says so, since approving it in Settings is what turns those updates into one click.

**The action column lines up.** A checkmark or a small badge at the end of a row was centred in its slot while a wide button sat flush against the row's edge, so the right-hand column read as ragged — and visibly out of line with the Homebrew row pinned below it. Everything ends on the same edge now.

## 0.3.46

**WeType (微信输入法) now reports the version you actually have.** Its version was being read off the name of the vendor's installer file, which turns out to carry the *installer's* version rather than the app's — the installer is a small downloader that fetches the real app separately, and the two numbers drift apart. Duo Updater now reads the same manifest the vendor's own installer reads, so the version matches your copy and new releases show up when they ship. WeType still has to be updated with the vendor's installer rather than in place: replacing the bundle skips the input-method registration step and was found to lose settings.

## 0.3.45

**A beta build can never arrive on the stable channel.** The fix in 0.3.44 looks further back through an app's releases when the newest one has no Mac build attached. That wider search could also see the developer's beta and release-candidate builds, which the normal check never shows you — so an app that happened to publish a release without its Mac download could have offered you a beta. Nothing had actually hit this, and now nothing can: the wider search only ever considers finished releases.

**Notion's release notes are readable again.** Notion restyled its releases page and Duo Updater could no longer pick the posts out of it, so the notes fell back to showing the raw web page. They render as proper entries again.

**PureMac's updates are visible again.** The developer publishes a separate command-line tool from the same place as the app, and its release was being read as if it were the app — as version 1.0.0, which looks older than what you have installed, so the app reported itself up to date and every real update stayed hidden. It now reads only the app's own releases.

## 0.3.44

**An update that only ever existed for phones no longer sits in your list.** Some apps share one version number across Mac, Windows, Linux and mobile, and sometimes a release goes out to the phones alone — the version number moves, but no Mac build is ever made. Duo Updater was reading that as a Mac update, which left an update you could never install and that never went away. It now looks for the Mac download itself rather than trusting the version number, so those releases are correctly ignored. LocalSend was the app affected; its row now reads as up to date, which it is.

**LocalSend installed from its own website updates in one click.** Now that the right release is identified, its Mac disk image can be installed in place like the rest.

**An App Store copy is never replaced with a build from elsewhere.** A few apps are published both on the Mac App Store and as a download from their developer, under the same identity — LocalSend is one. Those are genuinely different builds, and the App Store's copy has to keep updating through the App Store. Duo Updater now leaves those copies to the store instead of ever offering the developer's build over them.

**Updates that the wider ecosystem never picks up get flagged for us.** Our nightly recipe sweep could only tell whether an app's version could still be read, not whether the answer made sense for a Mac — which is why the LocalSend problem had to be spotted by hand. It now also compares against Homebrew, and raises a flag when we are reporting a version that nobody else has packaged long after it was published. Nothing about this is visible on your Mac; it is how this class of mistake gets caught by machine next time.

## 0.3.43

**Package updates are read more thoroughly before they are opened.** The check added in 0.3.41 asks an installer package where it installs, and refuses one that will not say. It was reading only the summary the package publishes about itself; it now also reads the package's own file list, which is what the installer actually follows. That means a package that keeps quiet in its summary is still understood instead of turned away. Every app that updates this way was re-checked against its real installer, and none of them changed.

## 0.3.42

**A download link that stays broken now gets noticed.** When a vendor's server has a bad minute, Duo Updater waits it out rather than crying wolf — but that was letting a download link that had been broken for good slip by unremarked, because it looked the same as a bad minute on any single check. It now tells the difference: brief trouble is still ignored, trouble that lasts is flagged and fixed. Nothing changes on your Mac; this is about broken apps getting repaired sooner instead of quietly staying broken.

**Release notes can't be pulled down to an insecure page.** A vendor's notes page is loaded over a secure connection, but nothing stopped that page from redirecting itself to an insecure one. Now it can't.

## 0.3.41

**Updating OneNote no longer installs the whole of Microsoft Office.** OneNote's update was being fetched from Microsoft's combined Office installer, which puts Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneDrive on your Mac along with it. If you keep OneNote on its own, that was five applications you never asked for. It now downloads Microsoft's standalone OneNote update, which installs OneNote and nothing else.

**Package updates are checked more strictly before they are opened.** An update that arrives as a macOS installer package now has to say where it installs, and has to name the app you are updating. A package that will not say is refused rather than let through. Every app that updates this way — Office, Edge, Teams, OneDrive, Tailscale, ToDesk, AweSun and the rest — was checked against its real installer first, so this should never fire on a normal update.

## 0.3.40

**Telegram's one-click update stops vanishing when Telegram's servers hiccup.** Working out where to download Telegram from needs one extra request to their servers, and those servers were intermittently refusing it — a few minutes at a time, then fine again. When that happened the update was still detected, but the Update button quietly disappeared for that check and you had to go to the website yourself. Duo Updater now retries before giving up, so a brief hiccup no longer costs you the one-click install.

## 0.3.39

**Package installers are checked against the app they claim to update.** Some updates arrive as a macOS installer package, which runs with administrator rights the moment you confirm it. Until now the only check was that the package came from the same developer as the app being updated — which would have let any package from that developer through, not just the right one. Duo Updater now also reads where the package says it will install and refuses it if that is not the app you are updating. Nothing changes for a normal update; this only ever fires on a package that does not belong.

**Release notes only open over a secure connection.** The notes pane loads a vendor's own page for some apps, and one of those pages was still being fetched over plain `http`. Those pages now have to be `https`, and a handful of other malformed addresses are refused outright rather than loaded.

**Fewer apps can go silently missing after a vendor renumbers.** Zotero's jump to `10.0` in 0.3.37 exposed a whole class of this: an app disappears from the update list, with no error, because the vendor changed how many numbers are in its version. Twenty-one apps — among them VS Code, Discord, Obsidian, Figma, WhatsApp and GIMP — no longer depend on that staying the same. The rest were checked and deliberately left alone, because for those a looser check would risk reading the wrong number off the page.

## 0.3.38

**The download percentage no longer spills out of its row.** While an update downloaded, the number next to the progress bar sat too far right — clipped by the edge of the list instead of lining up with everything else in the column — and there was more empty space between the bar and the number than there needed to be. Both are fixed; the percentage still holds a fixed width, so the row stays steady as it counts up to 100%.

## 0.3.37

**Zotero 10 shows up as an update again.** Zotero numbered its new major release `10.0` — two numbers where every previous release had three — and Duo Updater's check for it quietly stopped recognising the version. Nothing looked wrong: no error, no failed check, Zotero simply never appeared in the list, so anyone still on 9.0.6 was never offered the upgrade. It is recognised again, and the one-click install is unchanged.

## 0.3.36

**A package update that leaves the old copy running now offers to restart it.** Some updates install as a package handed to macOS's own installer, and when that finished it left the previous copy still running the old version — with no prompt, so you had to notice and quit it yourself. Duo Updater now spots that and offers a Restart, the same as it already does for other kinds of update. It only offers one when a copy that was open before the install is genuinely still running the old code — if the installer (or you) already relaunched the app, or it wasn't open, nothing is shown.

## 0.3.35

**WeChat DevTools (微信开发者工具) is checked for updates now — Stable, RC and Nightly each on their own track.** It used to sit there as "unknown": since version 2.02 the app reports Electron's stock identity on disk, calling itself version 36.6.0, and all three channels look identical from the outside. Duo Updater now reads the real version and channel out of the app's own configuration, so whichever track you installed is the only one you are offered — a Nightly install is never handed a Stable build, or the other way round. Updates install in one click, and the release notes for the exact build show up in the window.

## 0.3.34

**App Store updates stop breaking every time Duo Updater updates itself.** Replacing the app left the background helper from the previous copy running, and macOS then never started the new one — so the helper looked switched on while every App Store update failed talking to a copy that no longer existed. Only a restart cleared it. The helper now steps aside when it has been idle for a minute, which means a replaced app heals itself by the next update. For a Mac already in that state there is a **Restart Helper** button in Settings → Diagnostics and on the update that failed; it asks for an administrator password and takes effect immediately, no restart.

**Diagnostics can tell you whether the helper actually works.** "Enabled" only ever meant "switched on", and the difference between that and "answering" showed up as a failed update. A **Check** button now says which one you have, in those words.

**Backups: choose what to delete.** "Clean Up Now" only removed backups belonging to apps you had uninstalled, so on most Macs it deleted nothing and said nothing while the size stayed put. It now opens a list — every backup with its app icon, the update it would roll back, its size and date — with everything selected and anything you want to keep unselectable. The button says how much the selection frees. Backups whose records had gone missing were previously counted in the total but impossible to see or remove; they are listed too, marked unusable.

## 0.3.33

**A silent self-update no longer leaves Duo Updater sitting in front of you.** When it applied its own update in the background, macOS brought back the windows that had been open — and bringing a window back also brings the app forward, so an update nobody asked for landed on top of whatever was being worked on and stayed there. Duo Updater now notes which application was in front before it replaces itself, and gives the front back to it on the way in. Windows still return exactly as they were.

## 0.3.32

**Docker updated to the version it said it would.** Docker publishes its releases in an order that puts an older one first, and Duo Updater read the newest version from that list while taking the download link from the top of it — so it fetched 574 MB, kept a backup, installed 4.86.0 over the 4.86.0 already there, and went on offering 4.87.0. Downloads are now matched to the version each entry declares for itself, whatever order a vendor lists them in.

**An update that changed nothing is no longer reported as done.** The check that runs immediately after installing already knew Docker hadn't moved; it was overruled by a success message and an "Updated ✓". When an update we applied ourselves leaves the app exactly as it was, that is now shown as the failure it is, naming what was installed and what is still on disk.

**Silent self-updates no longer wait for an empty screen.** With the switch turned on, Duo Updater would hold its own update back while any of its windows were open — which, for a window people leave open, meant waiting until the app was quit. Open windows no longer delay it (macOS brings them back after the restart), while a Duo Updater you are actually using still does: it waits for the keyboard and mouse to go quiet before restarting itself.

## 0.3.31

**Installing Duo Updater's own updates silently now actually is silent.** The switch introduced in 0.3.30 downloaded the new version in the background and then still asked before applying it — the one thing it was meant to spare you. It now applies the update itself, at a moment when doing so interrupts nothing: no check or install running, nothing waiting to be relaunched, no Duo Updater window open, and you working in another app. It restarts itself there, without a prompt. Until such a moment arrives it simply waits, and if none ever comes the update is still applied when you quit — so the wait can delay a version, never lose one. Leaving the switch off is unchanged: you are asked, as before.

## 0.3.30

**An App Store update no longer blames you for a permission you already gave.** When DuoUpdater is replaced while it is running — by its own update, or by a rebuild during development — the previous copy of its background helper keeps holding the slot the system reserves for it, while macOS still reports the helper as switched on. Every App Store update then failed with a red line telling you to go turn it on in Login Items, where you would find it already on, and the button offered beside that message quietly did nothing. That state is now recognised and named for what it is, along with the one thing that clears it. DuoUpdater no longer tries to repair it by re-registering the helper: that was measured to switch the background item off and leave it unable to be switched back on.

**Duo Updater can now update itself without asking.** Settings → Updates has a new switch for installing DuoUpdater's own updates in the background, taking effect the next time it restarts. It stays off unless you turn it on, and the prompt-and-wait behaviour is unchanged for everyone who leaves it alone.

**Its own updates are noticed within the hour.** DuoUpdater checked for its own new versions once a day, so a release could sit unseen for most of a day. It now checks hourly.

**Eight more AI desktop apps are tracked.** OpenCode Desktop and OpenChamber follow their GitHub releases; Wispr Flow, Granola, Comet, Windsurf, AionUi and Msty are read from their vendors' own version endpoints.

## 0.3.29

**Installer packages stay the same package from verification to macOS Installer.** DuoUpdater now seals the selected installer before closing or replacing any existing Installer window, checks it again immediately before opening, and refuses the hand-off if another local process changed the file in between. This preserves Sparkle's signature guarantee all the way to the package you see in Installer without making the menu-bar UI pause while large packages are checked.

**Multi-installer disk images handle more real-world package names without guessing.** Versioned beta, release-candidate, Apple Silicon, and universal package names are recognized when they identify one unique product, while similarly named helpers and sibling products remain excluded. Older bundle-style macOS installer packages are supported by the same integrity checks.

**Failed installer downloads are cleaned up immediately.** A bad signature, unreadable disk image, cancelled download, or rejected package no longer leaves a full installer sitting in temporary storage until the next day's cleanup.

## 0.3.28

**Signed Sparkle updates that arrive as installer packages now work.** A few apps publish a perfectly valid, cryptographically signed `.pkg` instead of an app archive. DuoUpdater offered those updates, downloaded them, and then tried to unpack the package as though it were a zip — an update that could never finish. They now go to macOS's own Installer, after DuoUpdater verifies both the Sparkle signature on the download and the installer identity inside it.

**A disk image containing several installers is no longer allowed to make a guess.** Some vendors put a main installer, helpers, and sibling products in one image. Matching on a fragment of the filename could pick a helper simply because its name contained the app's name. DuoUpdater now opens a package only when it is the sole choice or can be identified uniquely; otherwise it stops and leaves the decision to you instead of presenting the wrong installer.

**The App Store helper is more tightly scoped to your login session.** The privileged helper now takes the account identity directly from macOS's authenticated XPC connection and refuses a request whose claimed user does not match. Normal App Store updates behave exactly as before; the change closes off a signed client from redirecting the helper into another user's session.

## 0.3.27

**Release notes show their formatting instead of its punctuation.** Notes that come from a project's GitHub release were rendered exactly as written — `**bold**` with the asterisks, links as `[text](url)`. Bold is now bold and links are links. This affected every app whose updates come from GitHub, which is most of the open-source ones.

**Arrow-keying down the app list no longer crawls.** Holding an arrow key felt like moving one row at a time through mud, and long release notes made it worse. Three things were doing it: a permission check on every app in the list ran again for every row drawn; the notes for whichever app you passed through were re-parsed on each keypress; and a long set of notes — one project's runs to 54,000 characters — was laid out in a single pass, which froze the window for about two seconds. The check is now computed once per list, parsed notes are kept, and long notes are laid out only as far as you have scrolled. Worst measured stall went from ~2.1 s to under 0.6 s, and what remains is the deliberate pause before the detail pane catches up rather than a freeze.

**Input methods are never updated by replacing the app, and 微信输入法 (WeType)'s one-click from 0.3.25 is withdrawn.** Settings were lost on a Mac during the work that added it. What we can show is that the copy in the protected system folder was never actually replaced by DuoUpdater — but an older copy of the input method was installed and launched elsewhere on that machine while testing, inside the window where the settings were rewritten. Nothing here is proven, and an input method's dictionary is not something to test a theory on: WeType now reports its version and sends you to the vendor's installer, which registers the input source with the system — a step that replacing the app bundle skips, and the likely reason that Mac then appeared twice in WeType's own device list.

The refusal is not specific to WeType: DuoUpdater no longer offers a one-click for anything installed as an input method, whichever vendor it comes from. Those apps still report their versions and link out.

## 0.3.26

**Three more apps now report their updates, and all three install with one click.** Hidden Bar, XQuartz and EasyFind were sitting in the list as a grey "unknown".

Hidden Bar is the interesting one: it ships with an update feed configured, so from the outside it looked like it was already covered. The feed answers, and is well-formed, and contains no releases at all — which is indistinguishable from a healthy feed until you look inside it. Its version now comes from its release tags instead. EasyFind ships no updater at all, so a copy installed from the vendor's site had no way to learn about new versions.

XQuartz installs through the system installer rather than by replacing the app, because it is not just an app: it lays down a whole X11 stack, and swapping only the app bundle would leave the rest at the old version. macOS asks for the administrator password itself, as it does for any package.

## 0.3.25

**Thirteen more apps now report their updates, twelve of them with one click.** GIMP, MongoDB Compass, Meld, Emacs, Tor Browser, Zotero, GrandPerspective, TigerVNC, qBittorrent, Opera, LibreOffice, pgAdmin 4 and Telegram Desktop were all sitting in the list as a grey "unknown" — installed, with nothing to say about them. Each was worked out by downloading the vendor's actual build and reading its identity out of it, so a one-click only appears where the download is signed by the same developer as the copy you already have. The exception is qBittorrent: its own build isn't signed by an identified developer at all, so it reports its version and sends you to the project's page.

Opera, LibreOffice and pgAdmin 4 nearly joined that exception. All three publish nothing but a directory listing, and listings sort alphabetically — "100" comes before "99" — so the newest release is not the first one on the page. Reading the version was never the problem; building a download link was, because the obvious way to build one would have picked whichever release happened to be listed first. They now download the release that was actually compared. That is the one mistake a signature check cannot catch for you: an older build of the right app, signed perfectly.

**1Password and Inkscape now install with one click too, and both were previously written off.** 1Password's official download turns out to be a small installer program rather than the app — signed and notarised by 1Password, so every safety check passes it, and installing it would have replaced your password manager with its own installer. DuoUpdater now fetches the package that installer itself downloads. Inkscape's download page hands out its file through a one-time link that changes with every release; the same file also sits at a plain, predictable address, which is what gets used.

**微信输入法 (WeType) now installs with one click.** It lives in a folder only an administrator can write to, which is why it used to only report its version. It now goes through the same administrator prompt as any other app in a protected location.

**Release notes for Opera, Inkscape and 1Password.** Opera publishes one page per major version, Inkscape one wiki page per release, and 1Password a feed — all three now render as proper change lists in the app instead of a link out. 1Password's version and its notes both come from that feed now, which is a published interface, rather than from scraping the page beside it.

**Discord's version check works again.** Discord moved its downloads to a different server and the check was still looking at the old address, so DuoUpdater quietly reported "no version" for Discord Stable while everything else kept working. It now keys off the part of the address that names the release channel, which is the part that actually has to be right.

## 0.3.24

**Fifteen more apps now report their updates, and all but one install with one click.** Rancher Desktop, Cherry Studio, RedisInsight, Upscayl, WailBrew, Wave Terminal, Lens, Termius, Unity Hub, iStat Menus, Inkscape, Google Gemini, Antigravity, AnyDesk and Kiro were all showing as a grey "unknown" — installed, with nothing to say about them. Each one was worked out by reading the vendor's own build rather than trusting a download page: the version now comes from wherever that app's own updater looks, and a one-click only appears where the download is signed by the same developer as the copy you already have. Three of them (Google Gemini, Antigravity, Kiro) publish nothing a download page can be scraped for; their real update services answer the same questions their own updaters ask, so that is what DuoUpdater asks too.

**AnyDesk in particular was written off and shouldn't have been.** Its download and changelog pages both refuse anything that isn't a person with a browser, so an earlier sweep concluded the app was unreachable. The plain-text changelog on the same server answers fine — and it is what AnyDesk's own Homebrew entry has always read.

**Updating an app in a location that needs an administrator password now asks, once.** Most apps live in /Applications, which you can write to; a few — input methods, for one — live where only an administrator can. Those used to show an Update button that could never work. Now the button asks for the password, and if you dismiss that prompt DuoUpdater takes the hint: the row switches to Open and stops asking on every release. "Ask for administrator access again" in the row's right-click menu brings the button back. The choice is remembered for that copy of the app specifically, so declining for one install doesn't silence another.

**An up-to-date Xcode beta no longer claims the vendor is behind it.** Under "Show all", a row whose vendor has fallen behind what you have installed shows a muted note saying so — you're ahead, nothing to do. Xcode was getting that note while sitting on exactly the build Apple was offering: it publishes a build number plus a human label ("27.0 beta 5"), and comparing that label against the plain "27.0" the bundle reports made a release look newer than its own beta. The note now settles on the build whenever both sides have one, so the same release is recognised as the same release however it is labelled. A vendor that has genuinely fallen behind is still called out.

## 0.3.23

**44 more apps now report their updates.** Apps that publish on GitHub but ship no update feed of their own used to sit in the list as a grey "unknown" — DuoUpdater could see them installed and had nothing to say about them. Bruno, UTM, kitty, KeePassXC, Godot, Bitwarden, VSCodium, draw.io, Podman Desktop, Anki, Raspberry Pi Imager, LuLu, MarkEdit, Clash Verge, Freelens, Tabby, Espanso, Moonlight, SwiftBar, Sequel Ace, balenaEtcher, DB Browser for SQLite, OpenLens, Headlamp, OpenMTP, Goose, Caffeine, noTunes, KeepingYouAwake, MiddleClick and a dozen more now show a real version, and 36 of them install with one click like any other app. Which ones was decided by downloading each vendor's actual build and reading the identity out of it, so a one-click only appears where the download is signed by the same developer as the copy you already have. Seven — Alacritty, Flameshot, MarkText, darktable, OWASP ZAP, BlueBubbles and Wine — publish builds Apple hasn't notarised, so those report their version and send you to the vendor rather than installing anything. LocalSend is report-only for a different reason, corrected here after this version shipped: its builds are notarised, but its newest release attaches no macOS download at all, so there is nothing to install until the project starts publishing one again.

Apps that already carry a Sparkle feed needed nothing: they were checked as part of this sweep and were already working, which is why names like Rectangle, Maccy, iTerm2 and Telegram aren't in the list above.

**An update that your Mac couldn't run is now refused rather than installed.** Where a developer publishes one download per processor, DuoUpdater picks between them by the file's name — and names are not always honest: three of the apps above ship an Apple silicon build under a name that says nothing about it, or says the opposite. Before an app is replaced, its new version is now checked against the processor in your Mac, read out of the program itself instead of its name. If it can't run here, the update stops and your working copy is left exactly as it was. Nothing about a normal update changes; this is the case that used to end with an app that no longer opened.

**An unanswered permission prompt no longer leaves the update check hanging.** To tell a TestFlight build apart from an App Store one, DuoUpdater reads TestFlight's own database, and macOS keeps that behind the "access data from other apps" permission. Until that was answered the read didn't fail — it waited, indefinitely, for a prompt that might be sitting behind another window or might never be answered at all, and the scan behind it simply never finished. Nothing timed out and nothing said why. It now waits a few seconds and then carries on without TestFlight's side of the story; the only thing missing in the meantime is whether those particular apps came from TestFlight, and it sorts itself out on the next scan once the permission is granted.

**Homebrew updates work behind a proxy.** If your Mac reaches the internet through a proxy, upgrading brew packages failed with `curl: (28) Failed to connect` while every other update went through fine. Homebrew shells out to `curl`, which — unlike the rest of DuoUpdater's networking — doesn't read the proxy you configured in System Settings; it only reads proxy environment variables, and an app launched from the Dock or at login has none. DuoUpdater now passes your system proxy settings down to Homebrew itself. Nothing changes on a machine with no proxy configured, and a proxy you've already exported in your own shell still wins.

## 0.3.22

**Claude's updates now show up while they're still rolling out.** Anthropic releases Claude in stages: a build goes to a fraction of Macs at a time, and the public download page only catches up at the end. DuoUpdater was reading that public page, so for the whole of a rollout — most of a day, in the case of 1.30096.5 — it told you Claude was up to date while Claude itself had already quietly downloaded the new version and was waiting for a relaunch. It now also asks the same endpoint Claude's own updater asks, which answers for *your* Mac specifically, and offers whichever of the two is further ahead. Nothing about which build you're offered has changed: it is either the public release or the one your Mac was already allocated. Claude also gains real publication times, so its releases now appear in the Release Log with the moment Anthropic shipped them rather than an estimate.

**A superseded package update no longer leaves its window sitting there.** Updates that go through macOS's own installer — Microsoft Office, AweSun, ToDesk — open an Installer window and then wait for you. If you left one open and a newer release came along, installing that one opened a second window, and they stacked up. The older window is now closed once its replacement is ready, and its download cleaned up with it. A window that's mid-install, or asking for your password, is left strictly alone.

## 0.3.21

**`duo` says which copy is which when two apps share a name.** Naming an app that is installed twice — two Xcode betas, say — printed both candidates as a bare "Xcode" and told you to name one exactly, which matches both again. The listing now carries each copy's version, and when the matches genuinely share a name it asks for the path instead of repeating advice that cannot work.

## 0.3.20

**"Open download page" no longer downloads a file.** On apps whose page DuoUpdater knows — ToDesk and UU Remote among them — that button handed your browser the installer package instead of opening anything: the link it used was the same one the updater downloads from, so clicking it started a download you didn't ask for. The page and the package are now kept apart, and the button opens the vendor's actual download page. Where a source only ever publishes a package and no page at all — a bare Sparkle feed — there is now no button rather than one that downloads something.

**The app list responds to the arrow keys again.** Opening the workbench window left the keyboard focus nowhere in particular, so ↑ and ↓ did nothing until you clicked a row — and after clicking into the release notes on the right, or switching to another app and back, they stopped working again. The list now takes the keyboard when it opens and takes it back at the points it used to lose it. Typing in the search box is untouched: a search you've started keeps the caret.

**The Brew section starts collapsed.** Casks and command-line formulae are a side channel for most people, and having that tree open by default pushed your actual apps up the sidebar every time the window opened. It now starts closed and remembers however you leave it.

**Xcode betas and release candidates are now detected, and two copies can be told apart.** Xcode was a grey "v27.0" with no update information at all, and if you keep more than one build around — a current beta beside the previous one — they were indistinguishable: same name, same version, same icon. Each row now reads its real build, so an update shows as "27.0 beta 1 (27A5194q) → 27.0 beta 5 (27A5237l)". Which track a copy belongs to is worked out from Apple's published builds rather than guessed from what you named the folder, and you'll only ever be pointed at something at least as finished as what you have — a beta can be superseded by a beta, a release candidate or the finished release, never the other way round. Updating still means going to Apple: the downloads need you signed in with your Apple ID, so the row links to Apple's download page and its release notes.

**Cursor's release notes are shown properly instead of an embedded web page.** Cursor writes its changelog as dated posts rather than numbered releases, so the notes pane fell back to loading the website. Each post is now shown as its own entry — its date, its headline and its changes — the same as every other app with readable notes.

**`duo check` now shows what changed when the version number doesn't.** Updates that keep the same version and only move the build — Surge, the JetBrains previews — printed as "6.9.0 → 6.9.0" on the command line, which was accurate and told you nothing. It now shows the builds, matching what the menu bar has always shown.

## 0.3.19

**Apps that ship their own updater are now updated directly by default.** These are the ones like Chrome, VS Code, Cursor and the Electron apps — and because they are also the apps you tend to leave running all day, the old default of stepping aside while they were open meant they were almost never updated at all: the row offered to open the app and left the rest to you. DuoUpdater now downloads the vendor's own installer and applies it whether or not the app is running, then quits and relaunches it so the new version takes effect. Anything that installs background components alongside the app — Tailscale, Office — ships a package that macOS's own installer handles, so those pieces are still put in place properly. If you would rather nothing was touched while an app is open, **Settings → General → Self-updating apps** still has the old behaviour, and changing it back does not affect anything already installed.

## 0.3.18

**An app whose developer changed its update signing key can be updated again.** Apps that update through Sparkle sign each release with a key, and the copy you already have carries the matching public key to check it against. If a developer generates a new key and ships it without a hand-over release signed by the old one, that check fails for everybody — the app's own updater is just as stuck as DuoUpdater was, and the update sits there refusing to install with a signature error. DuoUpdater now recognises that specific situation: when the new download carries a different key of its own and the release was signed with it, it stops trusting the signature and falls back to the same checks it uses for apps that publish no signature at all — the download must be validly signed by Apple's developer certificates, and by the *same* developer as the app it is replacing, for the *same* app. A download that fails any of that is still refused, as is a bad signature that isn't explained by a key change. Mirage Beacon 1.3.0 was the first to hit this.

## 0.3.17

**Update All no longer says a running app is finished before its restart.** When an update had already replaced an app on disk but Update All was still busy with other installers, the row briefly showed a green checkmark and disappeared even though the old version was still running. The app now stays visible with its running and installed versions, explains that it is waiting for the batch restart, and offers **Restart now**. The completion checkmark appears only when the update is actually in effect.

## 0.3.16

**Apps installed by a `.pkg` can now be rolled back.** DuoUpdater keeps a copy of the previous version before it updates an app, so a bad update can be undone. Apps that install through macOS's own installer — Microsoft Office, AweSun, ToDesk and the like — never got that copy: the rollback was skipped for them entirely, so the one kind of update DuoUpdater can't watch land was also the one you couldn't back out of. They're now backed up like everything else.

**Rollback no longer refuses apps that write inside their own bundle.** Some apps keep working files in amongst their own program files — ToDesk stores its settings database and logs there, and doing so breaks the seal Apple puts on an app. DuoUpdater checked that seal before restoring a backup, so for those apps it declared a perfectly good backup damaged and refused to put it back. It now checks the copy against a fingerprint taken when the copy was made, which is the thing that actually matters: that what's being restored is exactly what was saved. Tampering with a stored backup is still caught, and still refused.

**When a backup isn't possible, it says so instead of failing quietly.** A few apps keep program files that your account simply can't read — EasyConnect is one — and no copy of those can be made. Rather than attempting it and reporting a failure part-way through an update, DuoUpdater now checks first, tells you which file is in the way, and updates anyway; you just don't get a rollback point for that one app.

## 0.3.15

**The same app no longer appears several times over.** Some apps leave a dated copy of themselves behind every time they update — DuoPaste, for one, parks a `DuoPaste.backup-20260716-183428.app` next to the real thing on each self-update. Those copies are complete, working app bundles as far as anything on disk can tell, so DuoUpdater listed each one as its own app: three identical DuoPaste rows, each offering the same update. Worse, taking one of those offers would have installed the new version *into the backup*, leaving the app you actually use untouched and creating another stray copy. Backup and duplicate bundles are now recognised for what they are and left out of the list, as are exact clones of an app found in two places. Genuinely separate installs that happen to share an identity — Firefox alongside Firefox Beta, two versions of Android Studio kept side by side — still each get their own row.

**The list now reliably notices apps appearing and disappearing.** DuoUpdater watches your Applications folders so that an app updating itself in the background, or one you drag to the Trash, is reflected within a few seconds. That watch could quietly stop working — nothing crashed, nothing was reported, it simply stopped hearing about changes, and the list then went stale until you reopened the window. It's now rebuilt periodically and after your Mac wakes from sleep, with a fresh scan each time, so a watch that dies recovers on its own instead of staying dead for the rest of the session.

## 0.3.14

**An app that gets restarted after an update no longer jumps in front of what you're doing.** When DuoUpdater updates an app that's currently running, it quits and reopens it so the new version actually takes effect. Reopening it also pulled it to the front — so an update to something sitting quietly in the background could drop a window on top of the thing you were typing into. The app's position now survives the restart: whatever was in front comes back in front, and whatever was in the background comes back in the background, still there and still updated, just not in your way. The same applies to apps DuoUpdater reopens after an App Store update. Apps that weren't running at all are, as before, updated on disk and left closed — updating an app never starts it up.

## 0.3.13

**Fixes AweSun's update failing with "the server returned HTTP 404".** DuoUpdater worked out where to download AweSun's installer by building the filename itself from the version number. Oray then renamed the file — the same 16.6.0 build, one letter's difference — and every attempt at the update hit a dead link. It now takes the filename straight from Oray's own download listing rather than guessing at it, so a future rename won't break it again.

## 0.3.12

**An installer you've already downloaded no longer downloads again.** Some apps update through an installer package that macOS opens for you to confirm. If you closed that window without finishing — or quit DuoUpdater and came back — the row went back to offering "Update", and taking it fetched the whole package a second time. ToDesk's is 375 MB. The download was on your disk the entire time; nothing was pointing at it. Those rows now offer "Install" instead, which just re-opens the file you already have. If the installer window is still open it comes forward rather than opening a second one, and the offer stands until either the download is gone or a newer version comes out — at which point the old package would be the wrong one, so the row goes back to a normal "Update".

**Homebrew packages that aren't apps now show up.** DuoUpdater tracked outdated Homebrew formulae, and left casks alone on the grounds that a cask installs an app, which already gets its own row. That holds right up until a cask installs no app — a command-line tool like `codex`, a font, a driver. Those had no row anywhere: nothing for the app list to find, and not a formula either. `codex` sat three versions behind without a word. They're now part of the Homebrew panel, which reads "packages" rather than "formulae" to match. Casks that do install an app are still managed per-app exactly as before, and apps that update themselves are still left to their own updater.

## 0.3.11

**"Update All" now includes apps that install from a package.** A handful of apps — ToDesk and AweSun among them — ship their update as an installer package rather than something DuoUpdater can swap into place on its own. Those were quietly left out of "Update All" and had to be updated one row at a time; if such an app was the only other update pending, the button disappeared altogether rather than acting on just one. They're now part of the batch, and they run at the very end: everything that updates unattended finishes first, so nothing opens a window or asks for your admin password until the rest is already done. One caveat worth knowing — DuoUpdater can't tell when macOS's installer has finished, so if two package updates come up in the same batch, both installer windows open one after the other rather than waiting in line.

## 0.3.10

**Fixes updates going unnoticed for days at a time.** DuoUpdater re-uses the answers it gets from each app's version feed so it isn't re-downloading the same file every few minutes. The problem was how long it trusted a stored answer: when a vendor's server doesn't say how long its reply stays valid, macOS guesses — and it guesses longer the longer that feed has gone unchanged. So the very feeds that had been quiet for a while were exactly the ones DuoUpdater stopped re-reading, and a new release could sit there for days with the app still reporting "up to date" and no error to show for it. Every version check now always asks the server whether anything changed, while still skipping the download when nothing has. OrbStack 2.2.2 is the release that surfaced this; the same blind spot applied to most apps checked directly against their vendor, including Chrome, Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, Warp, Spotify, and Visual Studio Code.

**Homebrew-managed apps no longer get stuck at the version they were on when DuoUpdater started.** The catalog DuoUpdater reads to learn the latest version of a Homebrew app was loaded once per launch and never refreshed, which is invisible if you quit the app daily and wrong if you leave it running for weeks. It now refreshes periodically. As a bonus, machines with no Homebrew casks installed no longer download that 5 MB catalog at all.

## 0.3.9

**Uses less memory and does less work in the background.** This release is entirely under the hood — nothing about what DuoUpdater does has changed, only what it costs to leave running. Every update it downloaded used to leave a small amount of memory behind that was never reclaimed; harmless once, but it adds up over the weeks a menu-bar app tends to stay open. Separately, while the main window was open DuoUpdater re-read every installed app from disk every 15 seconds and started a system process each time to see what was running — that now happens every three minutes, since the filesystem watcher already notices a real change the moment it happens. Recording the release history after each check also used to save its file once per app rather than once per check, and release notes could be fetched more than once when the same page was already on its way in.

## 0.3.8

**No more beachball while an app is relaunching.** Clicking Update on another app while one was being quit and relaunched could freeze DuoUpdater for a moment — the spinning rainbow cursor, an unresponsive window, a click that seemingly did nothing. Relaunching an app now happens in the background instead of on the interface, so the rest of the list stays live and clickable throughout. The same freeze could show up when opening an app from a row's right-click menu, or when handing an update off to an app's own updater; both are fixed too.

## 0.3.7

**Backups from uninstalled apps are now cleaned up automatically.** DuoUpdater keeps one backup of an app's previous version so an update can be rolled back. Backups for apps you've since uninstalled or moved were never reclaimed and could quietly pile up gigabytes of disk space over time. They're now deleted automatically during the regular update check. Settings shows how much space backups are currently using, with a toggle to turn off the automatic cleanup and a "Clean Up Now" button to run it on demand.

**JetBrains Toolbox apps no longer show a stuck or incorrect "update available."** Version checks for Toolbox-managed apps (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Fleet, Air, and others) now always ask live rather than sometimes falling back to a local cache that could never actually report a new version — it fixes both a status that lingered after Toolbox had already installed the update, and one that never appeared in the first place.

**Claude Desktop's release notes are now shown in DuoUpdater.** Update entries for Claude Desktop now include Anthropic's own per-version changelog instead of a generic notice.

## 0.3.6

**Update All now also relaunches apps that were only waiting on a restart.** If an app had already downloaded its update and just needed a relaunch to finish — Claude, for instance — clicking Update All used to skip it, leaving a stray "Relaunch" button behind. It now relaunches those too, in the same pass, whenever automatic restart-after-update is on.

**App Store updates recover from a receipt hiccup instead of just failing.** Occasionally a Mac App Store update downloads in full but the very last install step trips over a "receipt" error — a transient App Store glitch that a second attempt usually clears. DuoUpdater now retries once automatically. If it still doesn't take, the row offers an "Open App Store" button to finish the update from the App Store's Updates page, instead of leaving a raw error on screen.

**ToDesk update detection fixed.** A change to ToDesk's download page stopped DuoUpdater from reading its latest Mac version, so ToDesk updates went unnoticed. Detection now reads the version reliably again.

## 0.3.5

**App Store updates no longer show a scary error for an app that's already up to date.** If the Mac App Store had quietly updated an app in the background — TestFlight, say — DuoUpdater's row could go stale and, on Update, try to reinstall the version that was already there. macOS's installer rejects that with an alarming red "The upgrade failed", even though nothing was actually wrong. DuoUpdater now confirms an App Store app really is behind before reinstalling, and treats a no-op reinstall as "already up to date" — settling the row quietly instead of showing an error.

## 0.3.4

**App Store updates now ride out network hiccups.** A brief connection drop mid-update — a flaky link, or a proxy resetting the connection — used to fail an App Store update outright with a "could not connect to the server" error. Those updates now retry automatically a few times before giving up, so a momentary blip no longer strands an update that a second attempt lands cleanly. Clicking Update again after a failure also clears the old error immediately, instead of leaving it on screen next to the spinner.

**Apps that update themselves clear from the list faster.** When an app like Chrome finishes updating itself in the background while an App Store update is running, its "update available" row now clears promptly — it no longer lingers until the rest of the queue finishes.

## 0.3.3

**One-click updates for four more apps.** HBuilderX, JetBrains Toolbox, and Microsoft Edge's Beta and Dev channels now update in place with a single click, instead of only telling you that an update exists. HBuilderX also now reads its version straight from DCloud's own release feed, so it picks up new builds sooner and more reliably.

## 0.3.2

**Self-updating apps stay in their own lane.** A running app that ships its own Sparkle updater is now handed off to that updater — the same courtesy DuoUpdater already gave other self-updating apps — instead of being replaced underneath it, unless you've chosen "Always replace" in Settings.

**Fixes**

- The running-app dot and "Relaunch" badge no longer briefly lose track of an app right after an in-place update, when macOS keeps its process pinned to the temporary swap location for a moment.
- When you restart an app yourself after it updated in the background, the "Relaunch" badge now clears the moment the app comes back up — instead of lingering until the next background check.

## 0.3.1

**Fixes**

- When you restart an app yourself after it updated in the background, the "Relaunch" badge now clears the moment the app comes back up — instead of lingering until the next background check.

## 0.3.0

**See when your apps actually ship.** DuoUpdater now keeps a Release Log: a running timeline of every release the apps you track put out, each stamped with its publish time. Open it from the clock icon at the bottom of the popover.

**Release-habit heatmap.** A new Patterns view charts releases by weekday and hour, so you can see when an app tends to ship — pick any single app for its own pattern and version history, or view all of them together. History is backfilled from each app's update feed, so the heatmap is useful right away instead of starting empty.

**Honest about what it can't time.** Apps that publish an exact release date (Sparkle, GitHub, Alcove) are timed to the minute. Apps that only expose a version number get a clearly-marked "≈" estimated window — bounded by when DuoUpdater last saw the old version and first saw the new one — and never skew the heatmap.

**Fixes**

- ToDesk update checks no longer report an older grayscale build; they now track the version actually offered for download.

## 0.2.0

**Passwordless App Store updates.** Updating Mac App Store apps no longer interrupts you for your password every time. DuoUpdater now installs a small, signed privileged helper (one-time approval) and bundles `mas`, so App Store updates apply directly in the background.

**Cleaner "Restart to finish" lines.** When an app updates itself on disk while it's still running, the pending-restart line now shows the real marketing version on both sides — e.g. `1.8.x (build) → 1.9.0 (build)` instead of a bare build number on the left.

**Fixes**

- Fixed a build issue on Xcode 26.5 (changelog extractor name collision).

## 0.1.9

**Apps that update themselves now clear correctly.** If an app updated through its own updater (for example, Chrome via "About Chrome") while DuoUpdater was busy installing other updates, it could keep showing a stale "update available" row long after it was already current. DuoUpdater now re-checks the moment the installs finish, so the row clears right away instead of lingering.

**"Update All" shows the whole queue.** Every app in an "Update All" run now shows a "Queued" state immediately, instead of leaving the ones further down the list looking idle with a clickable Update button. Clicking Update on an app that's already queued can no longer start a second install of it.
